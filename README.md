# Exercise 3

# Exercise Instructions

Objective:

This exercise will help you explore JavaScript operators and user interaction methods by creating an interactive JavaScript file. You'll implement arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and miscellaneous operators and combine them with user input to build dynamic functionality.
Instructions:

    HTML File (index.html):
        Create an HTML file that links to your JavaScript file.
        Include a basic structure with a message instructing users to check the console for outputs.

    JavaScript File (script.js):
        Implement the following parts step by step.

Part 1: Arithmetic Operators

    Declare two variables, num1 and num2.
    Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) to perform calculations.
    Display the results in the console.

Part 2: Relational Operators

    Compare the two variables using relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ===, !==).
    Log the results to the console.

Part 3: Logical Operators

    Create two boolean variables (isSunny, isWeekend).
    Use logical operators (&&, ||) to check combinations of conditions.
    Display the results in the console.

Part 4: Assignment Operators

    Declare a variable score and assign it a value.
    Use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=) to modify the value.
    Log the updated values to the console.

Part 5: User Interaction

    Use the prompt method to capture user input for their name and age.

Submission:

    GitHub Repository:
        Upload the index.html and script.js files to a public GitHub repository.
        Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the code.
    Video Explanation:
        Record a video explaining:
            Your approach to solving the exercise.
            How each part of the code demonstrates the concepts.
            Outputs shown in the console.
            
# Instructions to Run

# Open the Project in a Browser
- Download or clone the project files.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Ensure `script.js` is in the same directory as `index.html`.

# View the Console Output
- Right-click anywhere on the page.
- Click **"Inspect"** (or press `F12`).
- Go to the **Console** tab to see the JavaScript output.

# Requirements
- A modern web browser with Developer Tools (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
